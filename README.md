# DEPRECATED - SEE [V3](https://github.com/IsaacRudnick/TikTok-Discord-Bot-3)

Due to compatibility issues, this project has been reworked as noted above. This version (v2) is still semi-functional, but not consistent because of TikTok's continually-changing web-request handling.

## 📍 Overview

This is the fifth iteration of this project. It is labelled as v2 because it is a complete rewrite of the now-deprecated [v1](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/TikTok-Discord-Bot), which included the first four iterations. TikTok has continually been changing their API, which prompted the rewrite, aiming for increased stability and reduced maintenance. 

Features:

Responds to TikTok links with customizable embeds and the source video or image(s)
Supports missed-message rescanning and cleans up bot-initiated interactions.
Built in JavaScript using Discord.js and a third-party API for watermark-free TikTok content.
Designed for modularity and readability. Detailed documentation.

## 📦 Features

|     | Feature           | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The bot is structured around an event-driven design architecture, where dedicated handlers respond to specific Discord events.                   |
| 📄  | **Documentation** | Features full [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) in both main and utility/handler modules                                                               |
| 🔗  | **Dependencies**  | The project relies on external node.js libraries like discord.js, dotenv for environment variables, and tiktok-no-watermark-api for convenience. |
| 🧩  | **Modularity**    | The code is well-organized into separate, specific modules like event handlers and utility functions for readability and maintainability.        |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**   | The project's main bottleneck is internet speed for both requests to TikTok and the Discord API.                                                 |
